# this file will my list of things that I want to get done.

TODO get the motor drive running
TODO understand how to run the motors
TODO develop and algorithm that would allow the bot to navigate around the room to build a map and then stop when its
    feels like its confident in the map
To achieve the last one would be another larger task that should be broken more. will do after getting the motors running
